  "post": "As part of my mission not to add too much to my site at one time (as well as my love for the new [brutalist website](http://brutalistwebsites.com) trend), I have updated my site just a bit to add some more information and a new theme. I love the blue color of links on the web (#0000FF - the bluest blue) so that is the new color scheme. If you check out the home page, it has some fun javascript to expand the text on click, and some css to show which links are internal/javascript and which one's are external. I'll be updating the blog more (hopefully) with life updates, some thoughts I've been thinking about web design and the internet, and other random stuff. For now, check out the site, hit up my social media, and get in touch! I'd love to talk. \n\n conlin"
